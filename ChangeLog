[Version 2.1.2]: Feb 13rd, 2025
2.1.2 is a patch release to mainly resolve the stability issue of the 2.1.0 release series and fix a few distribution issues. All users of Unicorn are expected to upgrade.

- Fix several segment faults, including a few long-standing random segfault issues.
- Revive previous unicorn 1 test suite and related refactoring. @elicn @Antelox 
- Optimize memory handling and notdirty writes for faster memory access and snapshots, especially useful for fuzzing. @PhilippTakacs

As usual, thanks to all contributors and sorry if I missed your name here (please tell me @wtdcode !).

Lastly and personally, I would like to express my big thanks to @Antelox @elicn and @PhilippTakacs for spending lots of time improving Unicorn Engine. Also, there are a few big pull requests adding new architectures (RH850, TCI,  LoongArch64, AVR) and I will actively push them to 2.2.0.

-------------------------------
[Version 2.1.1]: Sept 26th, 2024

It has been a while since the last release, and 2.1.0 brings several exciting features. Below is the changelog from the latest to the oldest (though not strictly).

Highlights

- Revive QEMU logs, now we have `-DUNICORN_LOGGING=yes` to enable all qemu logs. @BitMaskMixer 
- Faster (up to 40x) write performance by not always doing `store_helper` and cleaning page locks. @tunz @boborjan2
- Brand new python bindings, with strongly typed and many improvements. @elicn 
- Fix to a long-standing MinGW random segfault bug.
- We bring python2 compatibility back.

- A brand new (and modern) java bindings. We are also working to publish it to maven. @nneonneo
- We have zig integrated. @kassane @atipls 
- Now Unicorn no longer allocates 2GB memory for every instance. The memory will be only committed once used and the upper limit can be adjusted with `uc_ctl`.
