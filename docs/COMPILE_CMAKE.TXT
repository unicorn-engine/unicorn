This documentation explains how to compile Unicorn with CMake on Windows or
*nix.

                        *-*-*-*-*-*

Requirements:
    Windows: MicroSoft Visual Studio(>=2013).
    *nix: GNU gcc. Python CLI to generate dynamic source files.

Get CMake for free from http://www.cmake.org.


(0) Tailor Unicorn to your need.

  Out of archtitectures supported by Unicorn, if you just need several selected archs,
  set the 'UNICORN_ARCH' in CMake. e.g.:

      cmake -DUNICORN_ARCH="x86 mips" ..

  By default, all architectures(x86 arm aarch64 m68k mips sparc) are compiled in.

  Besides, Unicorn also allows some more customization via following macros.

  - UNICORN_STATIC_MSVCRT: change this to OFF to use dynamic MSVCRT lib, Only on Windows.

(1) CMake allows you to generate different generators to build Unicorn. Below is
    some examples on how to build Unicorn on Windows with CMake.

  (*) You can let CMake select a generator for you. Do:
  
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      
    This last command is also where you can pass additional CMake configuration flags
    using `-D<key>=<value>`. Then to build use:
    
      cmake --build . --config Release
      

  (*) To build Unicorn using Nmake of Windows SDK, do:

      mkdir build
      cd build
      ..\nmake.bat

  After this, find the samples test*.exe, unicorn.lib & unicorn.dll
  in the same directory.



  (*) To build Unicorn using Visual Studio, choose the generator accordingly to the
  version of Visual Studio on your machine. For example, with Visual Studio 2013, do:

      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ..

  After this, find unicorn.sln in the same directory. Open it with Visual Studio
  and build the solution including libraries & all test as usual.



(2) You can make sure the prior steps successfully worked by launching one of the
  sample binary (sample_*.exe).

(3) You can also enable just one specific architecture by passing the architecture name
  to either the cmake.sh or nmake.bat scripts. e.g.:
  
    ../cmake.sh x86

  Will just target the x86 architecture. The list of available architectures is: ARM,
  ARM64, M68K, MIPS, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ, XCore, x86, TMS320C64x, M680x, EVM, MOS65XX.
  
(4) You can also create an installation image with cmake, by using the 'install' target.
  Use:

    cmake --build . --config Release --target install

  This will normally install an image in a default location (NOT SUPPORT Windows),
  so it's good to explicitly set this location when configuring CMake. Use: `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=image`
  for instance, to put the installation in the 'image' subdirectory of the build directory.
  Default value of 'CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX' on *nix is '/usr/local'.
